# Sponsored Pool

Gafi Pool offers the Sponsored Pool to give players more options to participate in Gafi Network and provide the method for game projects to appeal to their users.

The concept of Upfront Pool and Staking Pool is different from Sponsored, those are system owned pools but Sponsored Pool is the opposite, which means the Sponsored Pool is owned by those who created it.

Before learning how Sponsored Pool works let's keep in mind the three objects on Sponsored Pool:\
\
**Player**: the one who joins the pool\
**Contracts**: the smart-contract addresses that are whitelist by the pool owner\
**Pool Reserve**: holding the balance of the pool to pay 'a part' of the transaction fee

First, the owner will create the pool and determine the pool value that fits their users, following players will join the pool by pool id, make the transaction with the "Contracts", and the fee on those transactions will be subsidies by the "Pool Reserve".

As a player, when you join Sponsored Pool, in order to get the discount on the transaction fee you have to deploy the correct smart-contract addresses(on the whitelist) and make sure the "Pool Reserve" balance is not too low.
