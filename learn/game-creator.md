# Game Creator

Transaction fees are an essential part of every blockchain, the main role of transaction fees is to protect the network from spam attacks. In most other blockchains, transaction fees are paid to the miners in the Proof of Work networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum. In other Proof of Stake networks, those fees are burned apart and another part will go back to the reserve.

The concept of Game Creator is that the transaction fee in Gafi Network will be burned, sent to the reserve and a part of the transaction fee will be awarded to the Game Creator. This feature encourages those game creators or developers to contribute, to building the Gafi Network ecosystem.

At this time, we have not decided how much percentage of the transaction fee will go to the game creator, but this percentage value will be adjusted by voting in the future.
